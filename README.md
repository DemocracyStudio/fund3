# fund3
Fund3 is an NFT marketplace adding transparency and security to charity funding. The decentralized architecture offered by the web3 technology allows donators to allocate their contribution to the projects they cherish the most in the organization of their choice, track their money from the donation to the final beneficiary, and avoid misappropriation or scam. 

Fund3 is developed in Python, using Brownie framework to write and test smart contracts on Ethereum and Django framework as for the web app. 
The next steps of development aim to augment the platform with machine learning, allowing data analytics and predictions on the NFT transactions and marketing. Charities will then use this data to make informed choices about how they mint, price and marketize their own digital offerings.

While diverse embezzlement affairs and breach of trust were brought to court in the past years, suspicion arised toward charity organization and impacted donators' confidence. Fund3 will bring back confidence and offer an unprecedented way for donators to engage closely with the causes they want to support.
